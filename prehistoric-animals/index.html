        I’ve always been fascinated by prehistoric animals. As a child, my ideal day trip would no doubt involve taking
        the C-train to the Natural History Museum next to Central Park. The majesty of the building and park set the
        scene for the magic discovered and rediscovered inside. The halls towered, each filled with mysterious creatures
        of mammoth—an English adjective, redefined from the Russian word ‘<span class="italic">mamant</span>’, coined
        during the late 18th century
        Siberian fossil excavations—proportions instilling a sense of mystery in me. Our conceptions of these animals
        merely constructs changing with time. I, lightheartedly, reject the more accurate image of dinosaurs with
        feathers. Understanding they had them doesn’t change my perception of the scaly reptiles I grew up seeing.
        <br><br>
        Perception and interpretation are everything. <span class="italic">Prehistoric</span>—defined as relating to
        times predating written
        history—adopts new meaning in this manuscript: before history comes occurrence, and then memory. This manuscript
        is memory. A cache of bigotry, disdain, and trauma, but also of love—storge and eros—emptied from my brain for
        you to explore. I cluster the poems according to these themes. Each shares at least one central trait with the
        previous creating a cohesive journey through personal and perceived recollections. Just as the mammoth
        transcended from prehistoric to historic with the record of name and construct, my <span
            class="italic">animals</span> become history
        through writing and transmitting them. We are all animals, at the end of the day, on a spectrum of history—pre,
        current, post.
        <br><br>
        This is my first attempt at creating a collection of words to be shared with others. I would not have been able
        to do it without the guidance and feedback bestowed upon me by the entire ENGL91+ Poetry Writing Class and the
        profound instruction of Professor Sharon Coleman. Thank you to all who supported me, both in and out of class,
        my partner for insight, and everything that created the experiences contained within.

        Her back cracked in porous echo.<br>
        I wasn’t careful when I walked, no.
        <br><br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mindless steps anywhere I’d go.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fog rolled off the bay.
        <br><br>
        That fog rolled in and I obeyed.<br>
        Enveloped my head, I wasn’t straight.
        <br><br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In that cold blanket, I couldn’t think straight.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The brain’s processes move in waves.
        <br><br>
        My mind moved up and down and waved.<br>
        My new neighbors are hormones and we rage.
        <br><br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those hormones take control and we rage.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I dance the sidewalk and hit the cracks.
        <br><br>
        Crack after crack, her back twists.<br>
        I’m curious to see a spine in a circle.
        <br><br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can steps deform a back to a circle?<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I love you, mom, but I need to know.
        <br><br>
        I love you, mom, but I’ve lost control.<br>
        You make that broken beat, and I keep dancing.
        <br><br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can’t stop dancing to our discordant tune.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clicking and popping along in a groove.
        <br><br>
        I hope she makes it to the end of the song.<br>
        Her back cracks echo through porous bones.

        Looming in my subconscious a colossus wakes while I sleep and dream of trees as tall as skyscrapers peppering
        the skyline as far as I can see patterns scattered on concrete tar-tops radiating heat. I feel the moisture of a
        million breaths crammed into a tin to swim through the belly of the beast searching. Lonely closeness nursing
        ails near acquaintances on the pier nutcrackers keep me warm in Hudson’s breeze. Too bad things don’t taste so
        good coming back up as I purge the past in search of something new with space big enough to air out my dirty
        laundry in the backyard I just saw a reflection of myself in a rain-filled puddle pale and coiled all my legs
        still but in my mind I’m searching for the shelter of a stone or leaf where something won’t come along and eat
        me.<br>

            in his mania, he didn’t hide

            his skin contrasts too magnificently against ashen concrete to let <span class="italic">them</span> see?
            Worn down by disregard, he flaunted that brown skin and sung a downtrodden song all up along this street—the
            one whispering stay away,
            unheard in cacophony, he fell in <span class="italic">their</span> trap, just like me, we can't get loose,

            I’m not afraid to hide behind metaphor while I lick my wounds and perch in the rafters of an old house,
            solitudinous, peering out over a dog park where "<span class="italic">owners</span>" shriek to an
            Attenborough
            voiceover on the commonly
            exhibited erratic behaviour of the neighbor, the friendly neighbor acting beastly, the beastly neighbor
            acting friendly, like that <span class="italic">one</span> walking <span class="italic">her</span> dog past
            me on my smoke break. <span class="italic">She</span>
            said <span class="italic">I thought you were homeless</span> [sitting on the curb]. If this street is my

            to forget, and to survive is to forget, and I can’t forget anything, so I’m just witnessing it all while I

        still at the far end of the park<br>
        our beautiful day reaching its end<br>

        a pinch ran down my leg and up<br>
        my heart stung at the life gone<br>
        reminder buzzing of our power to harm<br>
