            This neighborhood’s signs read differently depending on your countenance, and residence, naturally he
            should’ve read, no breakdowns here evenings/weekends/holidays but he missed it in his mania, he didn’t hide
            behind that hornet tree across the way, deceptively pretty, temporary lodgings on chain link. Don’t you know
            your skin contrasts too magnificently with this ashen street, to let them see, tired of being invisible he
            flaunts that brown skin and sings a downtrodden song all up along this street, the one whispering stay away,
            lost in the cacophony, he’s falls in their trap — just like me, we can't get loose, scars keloid into hills,
            landscape altered
            <br> &lt&gt <br>
            I’m not afraid to hide behind metaphor while I lick my wounds and perch in the
            rafters of an old house, solitudinous, peering out over a dog park where “Owners” shriek to an
            Attenborough-style voiceover on the commonly exhibited violent, erratic behaviour of the friendly
            neighbor, the friendly neighbor acting beastly, the beastly neighbor acting friendly
            <br> &lt&gt <br>
            Like that one who passed me on my smoke break and told me she thought I was homeless. If this street
            is my home, when did I invite you in? Cigarettes are my time to forget, and to survive is to forget,
            and I can’t forget anything, so I’m just witnessing it all while I slowly waste away in memory
            <br> &lt&gt <br>
            Cherished memories here with my girl, walking the empty streets, a few years back, just us and
            the trees stirring fervently as the wind carried us home. The wind must’ve masked his predatory
            approach, I missed his looming silhouette, as we danced with the wind, the wind gives and takes
            in the slightest shift, he shifted in to my perspective, gray, crusted, stumbling,
            putting unrequested hands on her body, how uppity of me to ask for six feet, he’ll show me, charging,
            yowling, go back to Oakland, you Nigger. Privilege and information often don’t intersect, here, it, her, me
            standing here, in front of my house. He moved in across the street the very next year

            I love this progressive neighborhood, the grass is so green, it’s warm in the sun, yard signs exclaim
            unities and reassure me I belong, belonging lifts me so high that I grow wings and play tag with other
            butterflies on a luscious backdrop of flowers imported from every corner of the planet. I try not to
            forget about the hungry birds
            <br> &lt&gt <br>
            He forgot how hungry they are, and you forgot him already, he came hollering collapse that Friday
            before memorial day, down this street, this street who’s signs should’ve read don’t disturb our
            white peace and don’t blight our million dollar streets, but we’re not known for honesty here, we’re
            only motivated by fear and lies, motivated to paralysis, just like these streets, which haven’t
            changed in far too long, aged eyes and useless fingers idle/waiting/ready to break their
            obsolescence for thrilling 9/1/1s. You love saving the day, glazing over those unsightly cracks. He
            lives in prison now. They say it was warrants and thrown fries but I can see and hear everything
            from up here and I know []

        the sun peeked over the redwoods<br>
        still at the far end of the park<br>
        our beautiful day reaching its end<br>
        we walked together,<br>
        my guidance overpowered, she led<br>
        me with her strong opinions today<br>
        the route soggy with mud pockets<br>
        from mild summers and over-watering<br>
        land surveyors hunting the ideal spot<br>
        one where I could tune<br>
        in to her mouthy munching,<br>
        and out of the rest of the world,<br>
        while she hunted the perfect blade,<br>
        emerald grass or was it the wheat-like<br>
        variety that she seeked out? she was<br>
        a mystery and wonder and i was<br>
        only mildly aware of the clicking<br>
        of bike wheels rotating, bees buzzing<br>
        coloring in our paradise<br>
        her grassy grazing, me full of bliss,<br>
        the sudden shift as i sat,<br>
        a pinch ran down my leg and up<br>
        my heart stung at the life gone<br>
        reminder buzzing of our power to harm<br>
        a guilt that trumped the pain I failed<br>
        to hear the warning sounds I was<br>
        too entranced by her munchy song<br>
